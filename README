THANKYOUS

CQL is essentially a Perl port of Mike Taylor's cql-java package 
http://zing.z3950.org/cql/java/. Mike and IndexData were kind enough
to allow me to write this port, and to make it available under
the terms of the Artistic License.

The CQL package relies heavily on Stevan Little's String::Tokenizer.
Thanks Stevan!

This software package was developed as a component of a larger project
called Ockham which was funded by the National Science Foundation. For
